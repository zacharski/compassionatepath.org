title: About Compassionate Path
---
We are a small Buddhist community dedicated to<span class='marginnote'>Our Lineage from top to bottom: Rev. Dr. Daiho Hilbert Roshi, Rev. Ken Hogaku McGuire Roshi, and Rev. Dr. Soyu Zengaku Matsuoka Roshi </span>  helping people navigate joy and sorrow in their <span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/daiho.png"></span> lives. We seek to integrate highly accessible buddhist practices  and modern urban life. Using meditation, chanting, and study, we offer practical ways for people to skillfully negotiate the challenges they face and more clearly engage with the world.


Our aim is to foster <span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/McGuire.png"></span>a community that is both compassionate and engaged. This compassionate path is the root of Zen Buddhism and also aligns with Karen Armstrong's [Charter for Compassion](http://charterforcompassion.org/sign-share-charter) which states:

> Compassion impels us to work tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and put another there, and to honor the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect. 


You can get involved by dropping in to our Tuesday  night meditation group, attending a book study or service, or by scheduling an informal meeting. 

#### Our Lineage

The Compassionate Path community is rooted in the Soto Zen School and affiliated with *The Order of Clear Mind Zen* founded in 2005 by Rev. Dr. Harvey Daiho Hilbert Roshi.<span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/matsuoka.png"></span> Clear Mind Zen is an Engaged Buddhist training and practice order  in the lineage of Rev. Dr. Soyu Zengaku Matsuoka Roshi. The goal of the order is to bring about abundant good for all beings through social action. 

Matsuoka Roshi was among the first Soto Zen masters to teach in the United States.  He ordained three priests. One of them, Rev. Ken Hogaku Shozen McGuire Roshi brought the lineage to New Mexico in the 1960s. Rev. Ken was also a Great Master in the Vietnamese Rinzai Zen tradition. Daiho Roshi was ordained by Rev. Ken in 2000 and received dharma transmission in 2005.
