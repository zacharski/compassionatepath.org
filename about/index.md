title: About Compassionate Path
---
We are a small community dedicated to helping people navigate joy and sorrow in their lives. We seek to integrate highly accessible Buddhist practices  and modern urban life. Using meditation, chanting, and study, we offer practical ways for people to skillfully negotiate the challenges they face and more clearly engage with the world.


Our aim is to foster a community that is both compassionate and engaged. This compassionate path is the core of Zen Buddhism and also aligns with Karen Armstrong's [Charter for Compassion](http://charterforcompassion.org/sign-share-charter) which states:

> Compassion impels us to work tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and put another there, and to honor the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect. 


You can get involved by dropping in to our Tuesday  night meditation group, attending a book study or service, or by scheduling an informal meeting. 

#### Our Roots

The Compassionate Path community is rooted in the Soto Zen School and affiliated with *The Order of Clear Mind Zen*, whose goal is to bring about abundant good for all beings through social action. For more information see [our lineage page](/lineage/).

    This morning I vow with all beings
    To see the world clearly, As it is.
    To end violence
    And bring compassion to all beings.
