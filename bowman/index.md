As many of you know, we have lost the space we were using for Tuesday night meditations. The space we were using was the massage studio of one of our members, Eve. She graciously allowed us to use this space for free for a number of months, but the time requirement of being there every week to open up, stay for the meditation and then lock up, started to interfere too much with her busy family life. We really appreciate that she supported us in this way.

So, for the last few months we have been looking for a new location. We contacted numerous churches, yoga studios, and other facilities to find space we could rent a few nights a week, but that search was unsuccessful. 

Now we have a possible option that we would like your opinion on.




### The Bowman Center

We are looking at an option of renting out space in the [Bowman Center](http://www.bowmanco.com/Office_Space/index.htm) (the renovated Sylvania Industrial Corporation) less than 3 miles from downtown.

If we do take this space, we would be offering all our activities there including Tuesday night meditations, book studies, formal Zen services, and half day retreats.

The place is tricky to get to the first time. [Here is the map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/bowman+center/@38.2794364,-77.448925,822m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en). You need to enter on Joseph Mills Drive and go past some industrial buildings. There is good outdoor lighting on the office building itself. 

We are taking this quick survey before proceeding with this process.
We would particularly like your feedback on whether this location would be convenient for you. For example, if you have been going to the meditations, would you continue to do so in this new location? If you have not yet been to a meditation but are interested in starting, would you find this location good?

We are also interested in any other comments you might have.

#### Cost
As always, everything we offer is absolutely free. However, because of the cost of rent, we will be returning to our policy of asking for donations. Again, you are welcome to attend any event without paying anything.
