#### Our Leavells Road location
Our location is the next parking lot over from Vinny's Grill. Look for signs for an orthodontist as well as Dr. Arvan's dental practice. Once you turn into the parking lot, we are the brick building at the end of the lot. Just knock on the door! We are in a loft above a dentist's office.
