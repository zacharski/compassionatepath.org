#### Sunday Book Study

#####2:00pm. Location: Salem Church Library, 2607 Salem Church Rd, Fredericksburg
We <span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/tara-brach.jpg"> Tara Brach ([photo source](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/31/tara-brach/))</span> are discussing the book [*Radical Acceptance: Embracing Your Life With the Heart of a Buddha*](http://www.amazon.com/Radical-Acceptance-Embracing-Heart-Buddha/dp/0553380990/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455190721&sr=1-1&keywords=radical+acceptance) by Tara Brach. For current information about the group please see our [Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/)
From the Amazon description of the book:

> "For many of us, feelings of deficiency are right around the corner. It doesn’t take much--just hearing of someone else’s accomplishments, being criticized, getting into an argument, making a mistake at work--to make us feel that we are not okay. Beginning to understand how our lives have become ensnared in this trance of unworthiness is our first step toward reconnecting with who we really are and what it means to live fully."

> ""Believing that something is wrong with us is a deep and tenacious suffering," says Tara Brach at the start of this illuminating book. This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach's twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students."

Previously we discussed the book [*How to Wake Up: A Buddhist-Inspired Guide to Navigating Joy and Sorrow*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Wake-Up-Buddhist-Inspired-Navigating/dp/1614290563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441458774&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+wake+up) by Toni Bernhard. 

Please consider joining us!


#### Tuesday Weekly Practice

#####TBD
The core of our practice is traditional Zen meditation, which is silent and unguided. <span class='marginnote'>See [How to Sit Zazen](http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/about-zen/how-to-sit-zazen/) by the Dogen Sangha Los Angeles and also [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/howtosit/)  prepared by our sangha member, Lauren Jurgensen.</span> We meditate for two short periods of zazen (seated meditation) and one of kinhin (walking meditation). This is followed by a short discussion where we  talk about the practical aspects of meditation.  Beginners are welcome and basic instruction in meditation will be given at the beginning of the session.

Unfortunately, we lost our practice space and are in the process of finding a new one.

#### Sunday Service

##### TBD
Once we find a location we will be offering regular Zen Buddhist services which include chanting, meditation, and a short dharma discussion. Once this does get organized it will be announced both here and on our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/).
