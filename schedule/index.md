#### Tuesday Weekly Practice

#####6:45pm. Location: 11111 Leavells Road, Fredericksburg, VA
We meet Tuesdays at 6:45 for traditional meditation (zazen). See our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/) for current details. Traditional Zen meditation is silent and unguided. <span class='marginnote'>See [How to Sit Zazen](http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/about-zen/how-to-sit-zazen/) by the Dogen Sangha Los Angeles and also [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/howtosit/)  prepared by our sangha member, Lauren Jurgensen.</span> We meditate for two short periods of zazen (seated meditation) and one of kinhin (walking meditation). This is followed by a short discussion where we  talk about the practical aspects of meditation.  Beginners are welcome and basic instruction in meditation will be given at the beginning of the session.

#### Sunday Service

##### TBD
Once we find a location we will be offering regular Zen Buddhist services which include chanting, meditation, and a short dharma discussion. Once this does get organized it will be announced both here and on our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/).

#### Sunday Book Study

#####2:00pm. Location: Salem Church Library, 2607 Salem Church Rd, Fredericksburg

We just ended our discussion of the book [*How to Wake Up: A Buddhist-Inspired Guide to Navigating Joy and Sorrow*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Wake-Up-Buddhist-Inspired-Navigating/dp/1614290563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441458774&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+wake+up) by Toni Bernhard.

#### Our Leavells Road location
Our location is the next parking lot over from Vinny's Grill. Look for signs for an orthodontist as well as Dr. Arvan's dental practice. Once you turn into the parking lot, we are the brick building at the end of the lot. Just knock on the door! We are in a loft above a dentist's office. We are grateful to our sangha member, Eve Arvan for providing this space.
