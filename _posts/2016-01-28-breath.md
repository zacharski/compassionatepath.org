My last post was way back at Thanksgiving. What's my excuse? My life is busy, hectic, and chaotic. That is what modern life is for many of us. My wife gets home takes a few hours break to eat and relax then spends the rest of the evening writing work reports. My month long Christmas break is spent racing to get prepared for teaching the spring semester. Many of us feel that we are on the edge of chaos. That if we pause for too long we will teeter into chaos and something bad will happen.
