A few weeks back, Trina asked about the meaning of the circles that have appeared on each week’s the sutra cards. In Zen we call this an enso (円相), which is simply the Japanese word for circle. My [Zen dictionary](http://www.amazon.com/Shambhala-Dictionary-Buddhism-Zen/dp/0877735204/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441489790&sr=8-1&keywords=zen+dictionary) says it represents the absolute, the true reality and Wikipedia says it represents “enlightenment, strength, elegance, the universe and the void.” Then again, maybe it is just a circle. Nothing special.

Drawing them is good Zen practice. Too much thinking and you get a squiggly circle. Just doing without practice also leads to uninspired results. Some discipline is required.
Give it a try. Get the right amount of ink on the brush; have the right pressure on the brush; be aware of the paper, the brush, the ink, you—then out flows an enso.
